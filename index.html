            <img class="home-img" src="assets/images/01.jpg" alt="Donna Kuang" title="Donna Kuang">
            <p>Donna Kuang is an aspiring Web Developer, currently working at Strategic Factory as an Online Services Specialist. She plays a dual role in creating print-ready templates for online portals and taking part in the front-end development process with custom websites.</p>
            <p>Donna has a background in healthcare relating to nursing on a cardiac in-patient unit and physical therapy at an out-patient facility. While these career paths may seem disconnected, she has found that the process for troubleshooting technical issues is very similar to the planning of care for patients.</p>
            <p>Creating and building has always been a passion that started with knitting from childhood. Donna has made numerous hats, scarves, blankets, and amigurumi (or stuffed animals or characters). Building Ikea furniture is never a dull task when she is involved.</p>
            <p>Donna also enjoys hiking, rock climbing, painting, and puzzle games. Her latest obsession is trying to get 100% completion and finding all of the Easter Eggs in <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> for Nintendo Switch.</p>
